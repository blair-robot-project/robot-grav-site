## Positions
We have four elected leadership positions: President, Vice President of Finances, Vice President of Communications, and Vice President of Technology, who are collectively known as Upper Leadership. We also have between six and ten subteam leaders a year, appointed by Upper Leadership to run their subteam. Our subteams are mechanics, electronics, programming, and business.

Our current subteam leaders are Suveena Sreenilayam (business), Christina Chen (mechanics), Wilfred Nono (mechanics), Talia Nesin (mechanics), Karl Brown (electrical), Ryan Emadi (electrical), Anika Dasgupta (programming), and Noah Palosky (programming).

In addition to our subteam leaders, we have managerial postitions for team members who specialize in important roles that are not part of subteam leader responsibilites. Currently, those positions are held by Jacob Palosky (Design Lead) and Khushboo Rathore (Community Manager).
