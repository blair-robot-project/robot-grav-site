##Hyacinth
Our robot for the 2022 FRC RapidReact. Hyacinth was initially designed to intake from the ground and score in the low goal, then climb to the traversal rung in endgame to maximize our chances of getting both bonus ranking points. It was later upgraded with a toggleable shooter to be able to score in the high goal as well at the district championships.
