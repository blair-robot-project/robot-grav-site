## Mission
> Our mission is to expose students to complex problems in a collaborative environment in order to promote personal and intellectual growth while building and competing annually with a well-designed and fabricated robot. Through our activities, we encourage youth to pursue degrees and careers in STEM.

The Blair Robot Project was founded in 1999 by Mr. Mark Curran, Dr. James Distler, and a brave group of students interested in expanding their engineering knowledge building robots.
