FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), founded in 1989, accomplishes its mission through creative events and competitions. The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) that our team participates in is the highest echelon of FIRST events which combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. Teams of high school students design, fabricate, and program robots for friendly competition. There are currently more than 75,000 high school students on more than 3,000 FRC teams from every state in the US and 24 other countries.
