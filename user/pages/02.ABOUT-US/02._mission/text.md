## Mission
> Our mission is to expose students to complex problems in a collaborative environment in order to promote personal and intellectual growth while building and competing annually with a well-designed and fabricated robot. Through our activities, we encourage youth to pursue degrees and careers in STEM.

The Blair Robot Project was founded in 1999 by Mr. Mark Curran, Dr. James Distler, and a brave group of students interested in expanding their engineering knowledge by building robots. The Blair Robot Project is committed to fostering mental and social growth with students always at the forefront of decision-making, project leadership, and execution. Our self-driven members actively share their passion for STEM by teaching practical courses, attending outreach events, creating their own events, mentoring teams, and sharing their knowledge and resources in person and online.
