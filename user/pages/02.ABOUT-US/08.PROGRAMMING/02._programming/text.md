Team 449 is a leader in FRC programming, winning the Innovation in Controls award in 2024, 2018, 2017, and 2012. We have used [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin) since 2023. We have pioneered drivetrain characterization, writing a white paper ([found here](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/paper-frc-drivetrain-characterization/160915)) that has now become the standard for robot feedforwards. We have also won awards for our gyroscopically stabilized drive code and automatic shifting. In recent years, we have optimized the robot's movement based on detected game pieces and its current position, and we have developed features such as auto-alignment, making driving smooth and efficient. Check out our code on our [Github](https://github.com/blair-robot-project). 

During our off-season, we teach our rookies Kotlin and robot code through having them program our rookie [Bunnybot](https://robot.mbhs.edu/bunnybots), giving them slideshow lessons and projects that mirror a real FRC season. This allows them to be familiar with FRC code and our codebase before the season even starts. 

We also teach programming courses to students of all ages, our main class being BlairBytes, which originated as [Pandemic Programming](https://robot.mbhs.edu/community/pandemic-programming). We have since expanded this to an in-person initiative that provides opportunities to all students to learn Java, Python, and Scratch.
