Team 449 is a leader in FRC programming, winning the Innovation in Controls award for the past two years. Our greatest strength is our software design: we use [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) and a codebase designed around dependency injection to configure our robot code from a YAML file, giving us an easy, modular way to adjust our robot on the fly.   
We pioneered drivetrain characterization, writing a white paper ([found here](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/paper-frc-drivetrain-characterization/160915)) that has now become the standard for robot feedforwards. We have also won awards for our gyroscopically stabilized drive code and automatic shifting. You can see all of our code on our [Github](https://github.com/blair-robot-project). 

We have developed and continually updated a curriculum to teach rookies both the necessary Java for learning robot code as well as robot code itself. Our team also teaches an adapted version of this curriculum to middle and high school students through the George B. Thomas Learning Academy, a non-profit saturday school. More information about our class can be found [here](https://robot.mbhs.edu/community/gbt).
