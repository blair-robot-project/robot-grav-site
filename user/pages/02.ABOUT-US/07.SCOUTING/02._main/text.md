##### Motivation
Team rankings at competitions and Offensive Power Rating (OPR) are oftentimes not viable metrics for evaluating the quality of teams' performance at competitions. Additionally, they provide no detailed information about robots, such as their methods of scoring. Our scouting system makes up for this by tracking the actions of every robot in every match, which allow us to make well-informed decisions. [Click here](https://blog.thebluealliance.com/2017/10/05/the-math-behind-opr-an-introduction/) for an explanation of how OPR is calculated and [here](https://blog.thebluealliance.com/2017/11/06/opr-you-basic-frc-strategy/) for an article about the benefits and limitations of OPR.  
Additionally, our team has historically (pre-2016) not given enough attention or analysis to the data we collected. Now, our data is streamlined for [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), a versatile data visualization tool we use to chart information quickly and effectively. 

##### Scouting Procedure
Before competitions begin, pit scouters ask teams about their robot's capabilities. Pit scouters are chosen before competitions to ensure that they enjoy talking with teams and that they collect all the necessary information. During competitions, our team separately scouts for quantitative and qualitative information. Each match, six quantitative scouters each observe an individual robot and two qualitative scouters observe the three robots on one alliance. Since 2016, our scouters have recorded their observations on paper scouting sheets, but this year we will be using an internally-developed app for the Kindle. Quanitative data is then given to the data analyst(s) to create charts in Tableau. Some example charts are shown below.

Often with paper scouting, a separate team member specifically entered data into excel to be given to the data analyst(s). We designed our paper scouting sheets to be user-friendly for both the scouters and data entry person. We accomplished this by making the quantative scouting sheet answers all numerical and asking scouters to copy their responses to a vertical list at the side of the sheets. The scouting sheets were also organized chronologically and included diagrams of the field. We will be using bluetooth (as part of the internally developed app) to transfer data from the Kindles directly to a .csv file on the data analyst's computer this year. An example scouting sheet is shown below.
