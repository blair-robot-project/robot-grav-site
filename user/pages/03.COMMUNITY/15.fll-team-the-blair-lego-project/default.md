FRC Team 449 is excited to announce that we are starting a FIRST LEGO League team and are looking for students to join! If you would like to join our team, please fill out this application by June 30, 2022: [https://tinyurl.com/theblairlegoprojectapplication](https://tinyurl.com/theblairlegoprojectapplication).

FIRST LEGO League ([https://www.firstlegoleague.org](https://www.firstlegoleague.org)) is a robotics competition for middle schoolers. Students will learn how to build and program a robot (EV3 Mindstorms) and will design innovative solutions to real-world problems. Through this experience, they will develop leadership, collaboration, and technical skills!

We will meet for three hours every other weekend to build and program the robot starting Saturday, September 10 at Montgomery Blair High School (MBHS - 51 University Blvd E, Silver Spring, MD). Students will need to provide transportation for themselves to get to MBHS. We will have virtual meetings on the off week to work on the research project. Students will be expected to attend all meetings.

If you have any further questions, please email us at [theblairlegoproject@gmail.com](theblairlegoproject@gmail.com).
