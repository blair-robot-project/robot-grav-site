## George B. Thomas Learning Academy
As a long-term outreach initiative, our team has begun teaching Java programming lessons to students at the George B. Thomas Learning Academy, a Saturday school for all ages. Classes are provided in a self-paced, friendly environment such that the students can learn as much as possible to better prepare them for a STEM career in their future. The class is designed for students from families with low income, giving those students the opportunity to learn what they could not on their own. All students are welcome.
