 ## The Manzil Project
 In the summer of 2016, members of our team traveled to New Delhi, India to participate in a program sponsored by The Manzil Project, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing education for local youth from low-income backgrounds. Students ages 8 and up were exposed to STEM through our contributions, with the final objective of instilling a long-lasting interest in STEM. By the end of the three-week seminar, students were capable of building a robot with very little instruction.
