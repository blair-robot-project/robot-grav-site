Join our FLL team!
FRC Team 449 is excited to be continuing our FIRST LEGO League team!
FIRST LEGO League ([https://www.firstlegoleague.org](https://www.firstlegoleague.org)) is a robotics competition for middle schoolers. Students will learn how to build and program a robot (EV3 Mindstorms) and will design innovative solutions to real-world problems. Through this experience, they will develop leadership, collaboration, and technical skills!

Applications for the 2025-2026 season are closed. Please check back in May for application information for the 2026-2027 season.
