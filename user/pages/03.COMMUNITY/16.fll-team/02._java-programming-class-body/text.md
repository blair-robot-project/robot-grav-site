<h2> Join our FLL team! </h2>

FRC Team 449 is excited to be continuing our FIRST LEGO League team and are looking for students to join! If you would like to join our team this year, please fill out this application by June 25, 2023: [https://tinyurl.com/theblairlegoprojectapp23](https://tinyurl.com/theblairlegoprojectapp23).

FIRST LEGO League ([https://www.firstlegoleague.org](https://www.firstlegoleague.org)) is a robotics competition for middle schoolers. Students will learn how to build and program a robot (EV3 Mindstorms) and will design innovative solutions to real-world problems. Through this experience, they will develop leadership, collaboration, and technical skills!

Depending on the number of applicants, we will start either one or two teams. All teams will meet at Montgomery Blair High School (51 University Blvd E, Silver Spring, MD). Students will need to provide transportation for themselves to get to MBHS. Students will be expected to attend all meetings.

If you have any further questions, please email us at [theblairlegoproject@gmail.com](theblairlegoproject@gmail.com).
