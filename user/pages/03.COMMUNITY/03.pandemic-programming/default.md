## FRC Team 449, The Blair Robot Project, presents to you our summer classes!

### Check back in May for more information!


**What summer classes do we offer? Who are the organizers?**
So far, we offer classes in 4 different areas: Programming, Math, Science and CAD. Classes are offered through Zoom and at Montgomery Blair HS by High School members of FIRST Robotics Team 449, The Blair Robot Project.

Composed of students and alumni from Montgomery Blair High School and Montgomery County, our team continues to expand and attract new members since its establishment in 1999. We compete in the annual For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST) Robotics competition, a highly acclaimed event dedicated to encouraging students to pursue STEM and engage in the exciting field of robotics.

The mission of the Blair Robot Project is to solve complex problems in a collaborative environment to promote personal and intellectual growth, promote a student-led and mentor-guided environment, and build and compete successfully with a well-designed and fabricated robot. Additionally, through our outreach programs, we encourage youth to pursue degrees and careers in STEM.
