## What is Bunnybots?

Bunnybots is a unique and exciting offseason competition originally created by FRC Team 1540, The Flaming Chickens from Portland, Oregon. Designed to mimic the official FRC build season, a new original game is released every September and teams are given three months to create a robot up for the challenge where they then test their robots in a friendly competition in December. Bunnybots allows new members to gain valuable hands-on experience in designing and building a robot before the regular FRC build season. As Bunnybots also provides new members the opportunity to lead projects in a significant way, we strongly encourage veteran members to take a step back from the design process. We held our first Bunnybots competition in the 2018 preseason with a total of seven teams in attendance, one coming from as far away as New Jersey. All FRC teams are encouraged to attend and participate in this annual event. Information about the coming Bunnybots competition will be posted on this page.
