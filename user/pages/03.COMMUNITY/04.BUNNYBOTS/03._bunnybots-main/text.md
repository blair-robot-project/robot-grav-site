## What is Bunnybots?

Bunnybots, an offseason competition originally implemented by FRC Team 1540, Flaming Chickens,  in Oregon, is the ultimate preseason challenge. Designed to mimic the official FRC build season, Bunnybots is comprised of a FRC-style game released in early September, a three month build season, and a competition in December. Through Bunnybots, the team seeks to provide technical training to rookies, but also an opportunity for new members to undergo the complete FIRST experience. Veteran members take a step back from the design process, such that newer students have the opportunity to take leadership roles and be better prepared for build season when it comes. We held our first Bunnybots competition in the 2018 preseason with a total of seven teams in attendance, one coming from as far away as New Jersey. All FRC teams are encouraged to attend and participate in this event. You can read more about past Bunnybots competitions and 1540â€™s vision [here](http://team1540.org/bunnybots/).
