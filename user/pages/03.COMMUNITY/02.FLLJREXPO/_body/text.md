##Outreach at FLL Jr. Expos

_FIRST_ LEGO League Jr. (FLL Jr.) is a competition designed to introduce kids aged 6 to 10 to STEM. By allowing them to explore concepts in both science and technology using the familiar household brand of LEGO, young students and their coaches work together to design and build various projects. Expos are also regularly held, allowing teams to present their work and what they have learned over the season. At these events, our team regularly allows FLL Jr. participants to watch and control our robots, providing them an inspiring experience.
