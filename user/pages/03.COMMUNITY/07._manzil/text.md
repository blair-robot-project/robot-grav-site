<!--THIS IS THE OFFICIAL NAME OF THE PROGRAM-->
##The Manzil Project

[The Manzil Project](http://www.manzil.in) is a non-profit organization based in India that provides students lessons in academic subjects and the arts. Over the summer of 2017, several of our members volunteered with the Manzil Project by helping students practice their English skills through conversations and teaching a robotics class.
