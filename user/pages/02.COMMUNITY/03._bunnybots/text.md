##Bunnybots

Bunnybots is a unique offseason competition aimed at preparing rookies and veterans alike for the rigorous build season. Unlike standard offseason competitions, this game centers around an unofficial robotics challenge. Teams build robots from scratch to complete simple game objectives. The goal of Bunnybots is to give rookie members the chance to design, build, and compete with a robot and to give veteran members experience with leading an involved project before the build season. The "build season" for this game lasts from September to December, and culminates with the Bunnybots competition. The 2018 competition was held on December 15th.
