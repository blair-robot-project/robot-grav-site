##Java Programming for Robotics

Our team is in its second year partnering with the George B. Thomas Learning Academy to introduce a weekly
Java programming class for underserved middle and high school students. Aimed at students with no programming
experience, team members teach students how to code at their own pace, covering the very basics up to the 
necessary knowledge to program FRC robots.
