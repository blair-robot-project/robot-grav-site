Composed of students and alumni from Montgomery Blair High School and beyond,
our team has been continually expanding and attracting new members since its
establishment in 1999.

We compete in the annual For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology 
(FIRST) Robotics Competition (FRC), a highly acclaimed event dedicated to
encouraging students to pursue STEM and engage in the exciting field of robotics.
