## About Our Team

Our mission is to expose our members to complex problems in order to promote
personal and intellectual growth by building a well-designed robot.

Composed of students and alumni from Montgomery Blair High School and the surrounding area, our team has been continually expanding and attracting new members 
since its establishment in 1999. [Click here](../../about-us) to find out more about our team.

FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), founded in 1989, accomplished its mission through events and competitions. The FIRST Robotics 
Competition (FRC) that our team participates in is the highest echelon of FIRST events which combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and 
technology. Teams of high school students design, fabricate, and program robots for competition. There are currently more than 3,000 active FRC teams around the 
globe.
