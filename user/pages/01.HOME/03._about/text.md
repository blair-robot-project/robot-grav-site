## **About Our Team**

##### Mission
Our mission is to expose students to complex problems in a collaborative environment in order to promote personal and intellectual growth while building and competing annually with a well-designed and fabricated robot. Through our activities, we encourage youth to pursue degrees and careers in STEM.

##### History
Composed of students and alumni from Montgomery Blair High School and the surrounding area, our team has been continuously expanding and attracting new members since its establishment in 1999.

FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), founded in 1989, accomplishes its mission through creative events and competitions. The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) that our team participates in is the highest echelon of FIRST events which combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. Teams of high school students design, fabricate, and program robots for friendly competition. There are currently more than 75,000 high school students on more than 3,000 FRC teams from every state in the US and 24 other countries.
