After taking a break on Wednesday, 

Hey grab gang,

Suction Progress:
Got suction cups!
Got impeller out of vacuum
Did some preliminary tests with suction cups on the big vacuums
Only held so well with 2 suction cups
Had issues with seals - to be expected of a preliminary test

Velcro Progress:
Fixed cylinder problems (mostly)
Made new pushbar that goes all the way down to the wood backing
Did a little more testing
Video with pushbar (not the one that has holes for bolt heads though):

This worked better than yesterday's video. As you can see, we probably need longer cylinders. The holes in the bar for bolt heads will also help because they allow the bar to gain more momentum before contacting the hatch panel.

 Talia Nesin Talia  also bought stronger velcro after today's meeting so she is going to bring it in tomorrow.

BIG IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT:
After today's meeting, I have decided to drop the suction part of the grab hatch project. The reasons are as follows:
Suction has proven to be much harder/more complex than we initially thought. Due to this...
Suction will most likely not be ready by MVP due date
Suction has not shown any more potential than velcro
Suction and velcro both held about the same (velcro was actually a little better but I attribute that to poor seals when testing suction)
We cannot easily preload a hatch panel with suction
Can't have a motor running to hold the hatch panel before a match
Would require an additional complexity

So today we:
Discussed motor types and gearings
For the elevator belt we will use a single 775 geared 25:1 on each elevator will lift us up in 1 second
This equates to about a 5 second climb (down, drive, up, drive, up a tiny bit), maybe even less
For the wheels, we are thinking of using just 1 775 each, but need to make sure there are no problems with this (stalling, speed, ect)
Have not calculated the gearing for this yet (next meeting)
Discussed Sensors
We are going to use limit switches on the elevators
The limit switch will be stored within the top 2X1 crossbar hardstop, and between the bottom plate hardstops and in the side 2X1 tube mounted to the frame
Discussed elevator sliding methods
Roller Bearings
Decided to use .5 in roller bearings
Used them last year with no issues
We know how to get them to slide smoothly
Delrin Sliders
Decided against using delrin sliders as they have more friction than roller bearings
No need to do them when we already know how to make roller bearings work
We CADed
The basic structure of the elevator is complete and functional
All of the gussets and bearing mountings are complete
All of the bearings are mounted

Next meeting we will:
Continue CAD
Three main things
Figure out pulley mountings
Figure out motor mounts and sensor mounts
Figure out wheels
Also add rivets to ensure that there is no interference
CAD of iteration one will be done by Saturday morning, when we will go over the CAD with a technical mentor
Do math for wheel motors
On Saturday we will:
Do a design review with technical mentors
Start cutting and facing all the 2X1 we need for first elevator
Create layout for plates on one sheet
We will start queuing for CNC immediately after drive is done, as long as hatch doesn't need it
