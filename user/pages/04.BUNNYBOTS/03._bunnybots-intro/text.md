## What is Blair Bunnybots?

Modeled after FRC Team 1540's popular event, Bunnybots consists of a three-and-a-half month long "build season" in the fall. Bunnybots is an excellent opportunity for new team members to gain the skills needed to build an FRC-style robot. During the competition, they get the chance to show off their work and have some fun with an event designed just for them. 

This year, our team's leadership is designing the game with a focus on skills that are important to Chesapeake teams. As a result, we ask that participating teams include any skills they would like to develop on the registration form. The Chesapeake Bunnybots challenge will be released on September 1st. The registration deadline is November 6th for teams and volunteers. The registration fee is $250, with an additional $50 fee for each robot, but please let us know if you think that this would be a hardship for your team. 

If you have any questions, please email [blair.robot@gmail.com](mailto:blair.robot@gmail.com).
