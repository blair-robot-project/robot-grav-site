## **About** Our Team

##### Mission
Our mission is to expose our members to complex problems in order to promote
personal and intellectual growth by building a well-designed robot. Through our
activities, we motivate youth to pursue careers in STEM and work effectively in a 
collaborative environment.

##### History
Composed of students and alumni from Montgomery Blair High School and beyond,
our team has been continually expanding and attracting new members since its
establishment in 1999.

FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), founded in 1989, 
accomplishes its mission through creative events and competitions. The FIRST Robotics 
Competition (FRC) that our team participates in is the highest echelon of FIRST events 
which combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. Teams 
of high school students design, fabricate, and program robots for friendly competition. 
There are currently more than 75,000 high school students on more than 3,000 
FRC teams from every state in the US and 24 other countries.
