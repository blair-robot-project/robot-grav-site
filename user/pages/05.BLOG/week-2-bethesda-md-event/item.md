title: 'Week 2 - Bethesda MD Event'
---

Our team won the CHS Bethesda MD Event at Walt Whitman High School in an alliance with ILITE Team 1885 and Ursa Major Team 2849. This is the first time in many years our team has won an event! Coming into alliance selection ranked 13th, our team was the first pick of Team 1885, ranked third. Team 449 and Team 1885's strong scouting system helped them put together a strong alliance, choosing Ursa Major Team 2849 as the second pick. After two nail-biting finals matches (80-78, 76-77) that evened the score for both alliances, robots on both sides started malfunctioning and our alliance came out victorious 74-55.

Additionally, our team won the entrepreneurship award for the first time, where the team presented its new business plan to judges, along with a supplemental outreach binder. We are honored to see the recent growth in our business subteam be recognized and hope to continue improving our business and outreach as rapidly as last year.
